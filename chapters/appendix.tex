\chapter*{Appendix}\label{appendix}
The supplementaries are made up of $2$ folders: the \textbf{Maple files} and the \textbf{web app} \ref{ch:web-app}.

First, in the introduction seciton I've drawn several illustrations to hone-in some concepts, those are under \verb|supplementaries-thesis/maple/introduction|. They include \verb|cardioid.mw| for \ref{fig:cardioid}, \verb|damped-pendulum.mw| for \ref{fig:damped-pendulum} and \verb|polynomial-vector-field.mw| for \ref{fig:complex-polynomial-vectorfield}, respectively.

For all the netwoks analysed in \ref{ch:phoshpho-dephospho-crn}, their corresponding solving files are under \verb|supplementaries-thesis/maple/analysing-crn|. Even though the only two folders are \verb|net2| and \verb|net3| for \ref{network2_irr} and \ref{network3_irr_ss} respectively, parts of \ref{network1} were also solved using those scripts.
