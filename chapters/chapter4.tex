\section{What is a simple Hopf Bifurcation?}
A \textit{simple Hopf bifurcation} is a bifurcation in which a single complex-conjugate pair of eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix crosses the imaginary axis, while all other eigenvalues remain with negative real parts. Such a bifurcation generates nearby oscillations or periodic orbits.
