\section{Defining ODEs}
\begin{definition}
    \textit{An \textbf{ordinary differential equation} is an equation of an unknown function of one variable. This can be expressed as a function \textbf{of} this unknown function and its various derivatives}.
\end{definition}
Its general form looks something like:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3.1.1}
    F(t,y(t),y'(t),....,y^{(n)}(t))=0,
\end{equation}
Where $y(t)$ is the unknown function of independent variable $t$ and $F : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R},\hspace{0.1cm}\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. \\
This would be what's called the implicit form of the differential equation.

\begin{definition}
    \textit{The \textbf{order} of an ODE is the highest order of the derivative present in the equation.}
\end{definition}
In our case, the order is $n$.
If, however $F$ satisfies the regularity condition of the implicit function theorem then the equation can be written in a much more digestible form. \\
Restricting the domain $\Omega$ to one that allows the implicit form to be represented as a function of the form
$$
    y^{(n)}(t)=f(t,y(t),y'(t),...,y^{(n-1)}(t))
$$
would yield what's called the \textbf{explicit} form of the ODE. \\

The \textbf{implicit function theorem} allows one to convert a relation (implicit form) to functions of some variables. These functions may not be unique, but togather, their graph may locally satisfy the relation. \\
As an example: The relation for the unit circle cannot be expressed as a sole function, we'd instead need the union of the graph of two sepperate functions for expressing it.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $F:\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a continuously differentiale function. Let us express a point in the set $\mathbb{R}^{n+1} =\mathbb{R}\bigtimes\mathbb{R}^n$ as (t, \textbf{y}) = $(t, y_1, \dots, y_n)$
\end{theorem}
