ABSTRACT = {Most human actions are composed of two fundamental movement types, discrete and rhythmic movements. These movement types, or primitives, are analogous to the two elemental behaviors of nonlinear dynamical systems, namely, fixed-point and limit cycle behavior, respectively. Furthermore, there is now a growing body of research demonstrating how various human actions and behaviors can be effectively modeled and understood using a small set of low-dimensional, fixed-point and limit cycle dynamical systems (differential equations). Here, we provide an overview of these dynamical motorprimitives and detail recent research demonstrating how these dynamical primitives can be used to model the task dynamics of complex multiagent behavior. More specifically, we review how a task-dynamic model of multiagent shepherding behavior, composed of rudimentary fixed-point and limit cycle dynamical primitives, can not only effectively model the behavior of cooperating human co-actors, but also reveals how the discovery and intentional use of optimal behavioral coordination during task learning is marked by a spontaneous, self-organized transition between fixed-point and limit cycle dynamics (i.e., via a Hopf bifurcation).},
